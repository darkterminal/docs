Hello, I'm **Imam Ali Mustofa**, a **Software Freestyle Engineer** from ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©. Working as a waste of time and making useless things until everyone understands what I really do, because I'm too handsome to reveal it honestly.

I like to write code abstractly (_messly_) while dancing to the music I hate the most until I don't understand what I'm doing, then seeing it as an amazing work of art because I managed to stop time for a moment to understand what I've done.
