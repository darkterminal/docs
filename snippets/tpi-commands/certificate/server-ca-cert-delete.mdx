### `server:ca-cert-delete`
 
Deletes a specific Certificate Authority (CA) certificate or all CA certificates from the global store location.

**Usage:**  
```bash
server:ca-cert-delete [options] [--] [<name>]
```

**Arguments:**

- **`<name>`**  
  The name of the CA certificate to delete. Defaults to `"ca"` if not specified.  
  Example: `my-ca-cert`.

**Options:**

- **`--all`**  
  Deletes all CA certificates from the global store location. Use this option with caution as it is irreversible.

**Examples:**

1. Delete a specific CA certificate with the default name `ca`:  
   ```bash
   server:ca-cert-delete
   ```

2. Delete a specific CA certificate with a custom name `my-ca-cert`:  
   ```bash
   server:ca-cert-delete my-ca-cert
   ```

3. Delete all CA certificates from the global store location:  
   ```bash
   server:ca-cert-delete --all
   ```

This command is useful for removing outdated or unnecessary CA certificates to maintain a clean global store. Ensure you specify the correct certificate name or use the `--all` option carefully.
