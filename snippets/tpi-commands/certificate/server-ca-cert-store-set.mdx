### `server:cert-store-set`
 
Sets or overwrites the global certificate store location to be used by the server. By default, the store location is `{installation_dir}/certs`.

**Usage:**  
```bash
server:cert-store-set [<path>]
```

**Arguments:**

- **`<path>`**  
  The file system path to set as the new global certificate store.  
  Example: `/custom/path/to/certs`.

**Examples:**

1. Set a custom global certificate store location:  
   ```bash
   server:cert-store-set /custom/path/to/certs
   ```

2. Reset the certificate store location to the default by not specifying a path:  
   ```bash
   server:cert-store-set
   ```

This command is useful for customizing the location of the certificate store to suit specific development or deployment needs. Ensure the specified path is accessible and writable by the server.
