[libSQL](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) is an open source, open contribution fork of SQLite, created and maintained by [Turso](https://turso.tech). We aim to evolve it to suit many more use cases than SQLite was originally designed for, and plan to use third-party OSS code wherever it makes sense.

[libSQL](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) is licensed under an [Open Source License](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/LICENSE.md), and we adhere to a clear [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

<Info>This extension build using [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org) and using [ext-php-rs](https://github.com/davidcole1340/ext-php-rs) framework to create new PHP Extension.</Info>

## Features

- Embedded replicas that allow you to have replicated database inside your app.
- [libSQL server](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql/blob/main/libsql-server) for remote SQLite access, similar to PostgreSQL or MySQL
- Supports Rust, JavaScript, Python, Go, PHP, and [more](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql).

## Download

Download the latest build extension/driver binary you can see at [Release](https://github.com/darkterminal/libsql-extension/releases) page. It's available for:
- Linux
- Mac/Darwin
- Windows (still struggle, but you need to try use WSL)

## Installation

- 📦 Extract the archive
- 🗃 Locate somewhere in your machine
- 💽 Copy a relative path that address that extension/driver
- 📂 Open `php.ini` search `;extension` if you using nano (ctrl+w) then searching for it
- 📝 add in the next-line `extension=liblibsql_php.so` (in Linux) without `;` at the begining

Check on your console/terminal

```shell
$ php --m | grep libsql
liblibsql_php
```

Now, you can use `LibSQL` class in your PHP code!

## Quickstart

Remember, this is not a library or ORM, this is the native extension for LibSQL.

```php
<?php

// Instanciate
$db = new LibSQL(":memory:");

// Create table
$sql = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT, 
  age INTEGER
)";
$db->execute($sql);

// Insert data
$db->execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('Diana Hooggan', 24)");

// Read data
$results = $db->query("SELECT * FROM users");

// Display data
foreach ($results['rows'] as $row) {
    echo "ID: " . $row['id'] . ", Name: " . $row['name'] . ", Age: " . $row['age'] . "\n";
}

// Close database
$db->close();
```

That's it! It's feel like SQLite but it will more powerful 🚀
