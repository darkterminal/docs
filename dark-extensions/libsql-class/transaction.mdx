title: 'transaction()'
description: "LibSQL PHP Extension method `transaction()`"
---

The `transaction()` method in the LibSQL PHP Extension initiates a new database transaction, allowing multiple SQL statements to be executed as an atomic unit of work. This method provides control over transaction behavior, such as deferred or immediate transaction initiation.

## Method Signature

```php
public function transaction(string $behavior = "DEFERRED"): LibSQLTransaction
```

## Parameters

- `$behavior` (string): Optional. Specifies the behavior of the transaction. Possible values are `"DEFERRED"`, `"READ"`, or `"WRITE"`. Default is `"DEFERRED"`.

## Return Value

- `LibSQLTransaction`: Returns a transaction object that can be used to manage the transaction.

## Example

```php
// Create a new LibSQL instance
$db = new LibSQL("database.db");

// Start a new transaction with default behavior
$transaction = $db->transaction();

$transaction->execute("UPDATE users SET name = 'Glauber Costa' WHERE id = 6");

$another_transaction = true;

if ($another_transaction) {
    $transaction->commit();
    echo "Transaction commited!" . PHP_EOL;
} else {
    $transaction->rollback();
    echo "Transaction rollback!" . PHP_EOL;
}
```

## Notes

- Transactions ensure data integrity by allowing a series of SQL statements to be treated as a single unit of work, either all succeeding or all failing.
- The `$behavior` parameter determines the concurrency control behavior of the transaction:
    - `"DEFERRED"` delays the acquisition of database locks until they are needed
    - `"WRITE"` acquires locks as soon as the transaction begins
    - `"READ"` prevents other transactions from accessing the database until the transaction completes.
- Always **commit** or **rollback** transactions after their execution to release locks and maintain database consistency.
- Handle exceptions and errors appropriately within transaction blocks to ensure proper error recovery and transaction management.
