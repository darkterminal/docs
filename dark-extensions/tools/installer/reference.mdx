This command will (below ðŸ‘‡) be particularly useful when using the **libSQL Server** on your local computer during the development process. Additional features may be developed in the future to make it easier for developers to use **libSQL Database** and **libSQL Server** without any concerns.

## Token Management

The following commands are used to manage database tokens for the libSQL Server during local development. These commands allow developers to create, view, list, and delete tokens as needed.

<TokenCreate />
<TokenList />
<TokenShow />
<TokenDelete />

## Certificate Management

This set of commands provides a comprehensive toolkit for managing server certificates and ensuring server readiness. It includes functionalities to create, delete, and list Certificate Authority (CA) certificates, view raw certificate details, and generate peer certificates. Users can also manage the global certificate store by retrieving or setting its location, with a default setup tied to the installation directory. Additionally, a dedicated command is available to verify server prerequisites, ensuring that necessary components like Python 3, pip, and cryptography libraries are properly installed. These features streamline certificate management and server preparation tasks.

<ServerCheck />
<ServerCaCreate />
<ServerCaPeerCreate />
<ServerCaCertList />
<ServerCaCertShow />
<ServerCaCertDelete />
<ServerCaStoreGet />
<ServerCaStoreSet />

## SQLD / libSQL Environment Management

This set of commands is designed to efficiently manage SQLD environments and interact with databases. It enables users to create, edit, delete, and list environments, ensuring streamlined organization and easy access for future use. Detailed information about specific environments can also be viewed as needed. Additionally, users can open databases using the Turso CLI and run the SQLD server based on a selected environment, providing a seamless workflow for database and server management.
