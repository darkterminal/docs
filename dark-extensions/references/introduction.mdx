This document introduces PHP stubs for the `libsql_php_extension`, designed to provide PHP developers with tools for interacting with libSQL databases. Key components include:

**Classes and Their Responsibilities**:
   - **`LibSQLStatement`**: Represents a prepared SQL statement. It includes methods for binding parameters (named or positional), executing statements, retrieving results, and managing statement lifecycle.
   - **`LibSQLTransaction`**: Manages database transactions. It provides methods for executing queries within a transaction, committing, or rolling back changes.
   - **`LibSQLResult`**: Handles query results. It allows fetching rows, resetting results, and accessing column metadata (e.g., names, types, counts).
   - **`LibSQL`**: Represents a database connection. It supports creating local or remote connections, executing queries or batches, managing transactions, and enabling advanced features like syncing and extension loading.
   - **`LibSQLIterator`**: A custom iterator for traversing data, useful for handling result sets.

**Constants**:
   - `OPEN_READONLY` - Specifies read-only mode when opening the database connection.
   - `OPEN_READWRITE` - Specifies read-write mode when opening the database connection.
   - `OPEN_CREATED` - Specifies create mode when opening the database connection.
   - `LIBSQL_ASSOC` - Return associative array.
   - `LIBSQL_NUM` - Return numerical array
   - `LIBSQL_BOTH` - Return both associative and numerical array
