## Block Bad Words

<CodeGroup>

```php bbw.php
<?php

function bbw(string $words): string {
    
    $blocked_words = ['asu','tai','babi','bajingan'];
    
    $filter = "/(\b|[0-9_])(".implode('|',$blocked_words).")(\b|[0-9_])/i";
    $sensor = "***";
    
    $result = preg_replace($filter, $sensor, $words);
    return $result;
    
}
```

```php Usage Example
<?php

$words = "Cen asu kok kowe!";
echo bbw($words);
```

</CodeGroup>

### The Explanation

This function is like your super-strict, no-nonsense grandma who doesn't want you using any naughty words. Let's see what each part does:

**The Function Definition:**
```php
function bbw(string $words)
```
This is the entrance to the grandma's house. You give her a string of words, and she's ready to clean it up.

**Blocked Words List:**
```php
$blocked_words = ['asu','tai','babi','bajingan'];
```
Here's grandma's blacklist of words you definitely shouldn't be saying. These are the words she wants to catch.

**The Magic Filter:**
```php
$filter = "/(\b|[0-9_])(".implode('|',$blocked_words).")(\b|[0-9_])/i";
```
This is grandma's secret sauceâ€”a filter that looks for any of the bad words surrounded by word boundaries (`\b`), numbers, or underscores. It's like having a super-sensitive radar that can spot bad words in any form.

**The Sensor:**
```php
$sensor = "***";
```
This is grandma's solution: whenever she finds a bad word, she replaces it with stars. It's like putting a bar of soap in your mouth, but less gross.

**Cleansing the Words:**
```php
$result = preg_replace($filter, $sensor, $words);
```
Grandma applies her filter to the words you gave her. Any bad words she finds get scrubbed out with her sensor stars.

**Return the Clean Version:**
```php
return $result;
```
Finally, she hands back the cleaned-up version of your sentence, free from any naughty words. You can go back to your friends and use it without getting a scolding!

### In Summary

This function `bbw` (maybe it stands for "_Better Beep Words_"?) takes a string, checks it for any bad words from a predefined list, and replaces those words with `***`. It's like having an automatic censor that ensures your language stays clean and grandma-approved.

## Check Provider By Phone Number

<CodeGroup>

```php check_provider.php
<?php

function check_provider(int $number): string {
    $telkomsel = '/^(0811|0812|0813|0821|0822|0852|0853|0823|0851)/';
    $indosat = '/^(0814|0815|0816|0855|0856|0857|0858)/';
    $xl = '/^(0817|0818|0819|0859|0877|0878)/';
    $axis = '/^(0838|0831|0832|0833)/';
    $three = '/^(0895|0896|0897|0898|0899)/';
    $smartfreen = '/^(0881|0882|0883|0884|0885|0886|0887|0888|0889)/';
    $ceria = '/^(0828)/';

    if (preg_match($telkomsel, $number)) {
        return 'Provider Telkomsel';
    } elseif (preg_match($indosat, $number)) {
        return 'Provider Indosat';
    } elseif (preg_match($xl, $number)) {
        return 'Provider XL';
    } elseif (preg_match($axis, $number)) {
        return 'Provider Axis';
    } elseif (preg_match($three, $number)) {
        return 'Provider 3 (Three)';
    } elseif (preg_match($smartfreen, $number)) {
        return 'Provider Smartfreen';
    } elseif (preg_match($ceria, $number)) {
        return 'Provider Ceria';
    } else {
        return 'Unknown Provider';
    }
}
```

```php Usage Example
<?php

$number = '08123456789';
echo check_provider($number);
```

</CodeGroup>

### The Explanation

**The Function Definition**

This function is like a detective trying to figure out which phone provider a given number belongs to. It takes a phone number as input and returns the corresponding provider.

```php
function check_provider($number)
```

**The Provider Patterns**

These are like the wanted posters for each phone provider. Each regular expression is a pattern that matches phone numbers associated with a specific provider.

```php
$telkomsel = '/^(0811|0812|0813|0821|0822|0852|0853|0823|0851)/';
$indosat = '/^(0814|0815|0816|0855|0856|0857|0858)/';
$xl = '/^(0817|0818|0819|0859|0877|0878)/';
$axis = '/^(0838|0831|0832|0833)/';
$three = '/^(0895|0896|0897|0898|0899)/';
$smartfreen = '/^(0881|0882|0883|0884|0885|0886|0887|0888|0889)/';
$ceria = '/^(0828)/';
```

**The Investigation**

Here, our detective uses each wanted poster (regular expression) to check if the provided phone number matches any of them. If a match is found, the detective concludes that the number belongs to the corresponding provider.

```php
if (preg_match($telkomsel, $number)) {
    return 'Provider Telkomsel';
} elseif (preg_match($indosat, $number)) {
    return 'Provider Indosat';
} elseif (preg_match($xl, $number)) {
    return 'Provider XL';
} elseif (preg_match($axis, $number)) {
    return 'Provider Axis';
} elseif (preg_match($three, $number)) {
    return 'Provider 3 (Three)';
} elseif (preg_match($smartfreen, $number)) {
    return 'Provider Smartfreen';
} elseif (preg_match($ceria, $number)) {
    return 'Provider Ceria';
} else {
    return 'Unknown Provider';
}
```

### In Summary

This function `check_provider` is like a detective with a bunch of wanted posters, trying to match a given phone number to a specific phone provider. It's a fun way to determine who's behind a phone number!
